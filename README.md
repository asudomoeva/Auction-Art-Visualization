# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization for Art Auction Data

## Introduction

This project performs an exploratory analysis and visualization on a dataset containing the historical auction prices of thousands of pieces of art. Whether you come from the arts and humanities, or economics and finance, art is an interesting and complex field. With new data starting to become available, for the first time we have the ability to analyze and better understand this historically opaque industry. It is a potential treasure trove for data scientists.

For hundreds of years fine art has been valued by cultures throughout the world for its aesthetic and beauty, but fine art as an asset class also appeals to many people today as an attractive alternative investment that is largely non-correlated to the traditional stock market. The fine art asset class is estimated to have a global market value of over $60 billion in annual turnover and has historically outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of compound annual growth (specifically, 15-year CAGR). Geographically, the art market has for decades been dominated by the United States, United Kingdom and China with the greatest concentration of art sales in the entire world occurring right here in New York City.

Each of our team members has a diverse background. In addition to experience as data scientists, a few of us have a background in economics and have worked for financial services and tech companies. A few of us have also worked in the art industry for galleries or collectors. This topic was a cross-section of our experiences and interests that allowed us to explore timely questions about the prices and dynamics of the fine art market.

From a high level, the questions that intrigued us most were related to knowing more about the auction sale prices (called hammer prices) for pieces of art (called lots) in terms of different artists, location and time periods. We initially developed a large list of potential questions, and narrowed these down based on viability in terms of the data we had available as well as the scope and time constraints for the project. Some of the specific questions we decided to look at are:

What is the distribution of quantity of lots and auctions by location, year, and season?
What are the lot titles that have higher price or appear more?
How is price related to artistâ€™s era/when he/she was born?
Do auction prices vary by location and season?
Did Financial Crisis have any effect on the auctions?
Does the order in which the lot is presented affect the overall sell price?

The detailed final report as well as an interactive component of the analysis are shared in this repo for your convinience.
